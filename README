NAME
    fakechroot - gives a fake chroot environment

DESCRIPTION
    fakechroot runs a command in an environment were is additional
    possibility to use chroot(8) command without root privileges. This is
    useful for allowing users to create own chrooted environment with
    possibility to install another packages without need for root
    privileges.

    fakechroot replaces more library functions (chroot(2), open(2), etc.) by
    ones that simulate the effect the real library functions would have had,
    had the user really been in chroot. These wrapper functions are in a
    shared library /usr/lib/fakechroot/libfakechroot.so which is loaded
    through the LD_PRELOAD mechanism of the dynamic loader. (See ld.so(8))

    In fake chroot you can install Debian bootstrap with `debootstrap
    --variant=fakechroot' command. In this environment you can use i.e.
    apt-get(8) command to install another packages from common user's
    account.

    In the current version, the fakechroot does not provide the fakeroot(1)
    functionality! You might to call fakechroot with fakeroot command, if
    you want to emulate root environment, i.e.:

     $ fakeroot fakechroot /usr/sbin/chroot /tmp/debian /bin/sh
     # id
     uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

SECURITY ASPECTS
    fakechroot is a regular, non-setuid program. It does not enhance a
    user's privileges, or decrease the system's security.
